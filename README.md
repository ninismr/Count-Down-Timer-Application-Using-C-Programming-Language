# Count-Down/Timer Application using C# Programming Language
This is a project of the Computing Career and Programming course. This project aims to do a count-down or I can say this is a simple timer application with a form of 'MM:SS' in which the user can input the minutes and seconds by choosing the desired number in a combobox. This application is created using C# programming language and also the user can control or use the application using 2 buttons which are 'start' used to start the application, and 'stop' used to stop the application.
